# triangles_dfs_python

This program is simulation for a task 16 from math high school entry test from first attempt in 2023
the purpose of writing this is to ensure understanding of how the final triangles looks like and get their count
(not to simulate their splitting, see bellow)

The task description:
The first figure is a white equilateral triangle.
Each next shape is created from the previous shape according to the following rules:
1. First, we divide each white triangle in the figure into 4 identical equilateral triangles.
2. Then in each of the four white triangles created in this way, we color the inner triangle gray.

This part of the program is able to count and draw triangles until the 10th level, which is enough to solve the task
using DFS
IT PRINT ONE TRIANGLE BASED ON CHOSEN THE LEVEL (NUMBER)
